# RTI STAR (Statistical Traffic Analysis Report)

STAR is a Python/Flask-based web application created to help examine traffic 
stop records for evidence of racial disproportionality and is based on the 
[Veil of Darkness method developed by Grogger & Ridgeway (2006)](http://www.rand.org/pubs/reprints/RP1253.html).
