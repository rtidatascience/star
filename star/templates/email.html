        Based on statistical significance alone (p<0.05), this evidence
        suggests there <em>may</em> be racial disproportionality in
        traffic stops;
        in-depth analysis of the data is recommended.  All estimates are
        sensitive to model specification and the user may wish to
        perform
        additional analysis. Given the typically large sample sizes
        available for traffic stop data, we recommend that
        interpretation
        of results be more focused on whether the size of the difference
        in the reported percentages (or, equivalently, their ratio) is
        meaningfully large for your community.

    <p>
        Based on statistical significance alone (p>=0.05), this evidence
        does not
        suggest the existence of racial disproportionality in traffic
        stops.
        However, given the typically large sample sizes available for
        traffic stop data,
        we recommend that interpretation of results be more focused on
        whether the size
        of the difference in the reported percentages (or, equivalently,
        their ratio)

    The regression model indicates that the risk of being in the
    reference group was
    {{ "%.2f%%" | format(results.light_prob) }}
    during the light portion of the intertwilight period and
    {{ "%.2f%%" | format(results.dark_prob) }}
    during the dark portion of the intertwilight period, with a
    corresponding risk ratio of
    {{ "%.2f" | format(results.risk_ratio_day) }}. The p-value for the
    effect of light
    versus dark was
    {{ "%.4f" | format(results.p_value_day) }}.

<h3>Methodology</h3>

<p>
    To study the racial distribution of traffic stops, the tool uses
    the Veil of Darkness (VOD) approach, which is based on the logic
    that police officers are less capable of determining the race of
    a motorist after dark than they are during daylight. Using this
    method, the existence of racial disproportionality in traffic
    stops is assessed by comparing the race distribution of stops
    made during daylight to the race distribution of stops made
    after dark, after adjusting for other factors in a regression
    model. The analysis is limited to stops that occur during the
    evening intertwilight period (roughly between 5:00 PM and 9:00
    PM, depending on location) in order to reduce the variation in
    travel patterns that are conditional on time of day.
</p>

<p>
    The VOD method was developed and first employed by Jeffery
    Grogger and Greg Ridgeway in an analysis of traffic stops in
    Oakland, California, and Cincinnati, Ohio. The method has also
    been used in studies focusing on the nature of traffic stops in
    Minneapolis, Minnesota, Syracuse, New York, and more recently in
    San Diego, California, and the state of Connecticut.
</p>

<p>
    Our tool incorporates one enhancement from these previous
    studies.  That is, our model accounts for within-officer
    correlation that is likely to occur (when this information is
    available in the data). By doing so, we recognize that officers
    may have inherent differences in the percentage of a racial or
    ethnic subset of the population that they are likely to
    encounter. These differences may be caused by factors such as
    geographic deployment or unit assignment.
</p>

<h3>How to interpret results</h3>

<p>
    One benefit of the VOD approach is its statistical
    quantification of
    disproportionality present in a community using a reliable data
    source.  If the reported <strong>risk ratio</strong> (i.e., risk
    of being in a
    traffic stop reference group during light vs. dark periods) is
    acceptably close to 1.0, or in other words if the
    <strong>percentages</strong>
    of
    reference group traffic stops during light vs. dark
    intertwilight
    are acceptably close to one another, it suggests that daylight
    was
    not meaningfully associated with the race or ethnicity of the
    driver
    who was stopped.  Alternatively, if the risk ratio is
    meaningfully
    <em>greater than 1.0</em>, it suggests possible racial
    disproportionality
    (i.e., that reference group motorists, a racial or ethnic subset
    of
    the population of interest, are more likely to be among those
    stopped during times when visibility is higher compared to times
    when visibility is lower).
</p>

<p>
    We provide the <strong>level of statistical
    significance</strong> for the effect of daylight vs.
    intertwilight as well.  Significance levels between 0 and 0.05
    (when accompanied
    by risk ratios <em>greater than 1.0</em>) are more indicative of
    a potential problem with
    disproportionality, and significance levels between 0.05 and 1.0
    are less
    indicative of a potential problem.  However, given the large
    sample sizes
    available for traffic stop data, interpretation of results
    should be more
    focused on the size of the difference in the percentages (or,
    equivalently,
    their ratio).
</p>
<p>
    This tool provides a quantified description of traffic stop
    disparities in a community. The results can be useful in a
    number
    of ways: to determine whether there is meaningful evidence of
    racial disproportionality in traffic stops for a given reference
    group, to compare results across various subgroups of stops
    (e.g.,
    across gender, across police units) to pinpoint subgroups that
    need
    more attention than others, and to compare results before vs.
    after
    an intervention is implemented. 
</p>
<p>
    This method identifies patterns of disproportionate contact with
    law enforcement in regard to traffic stops for selected reference
    groups in a defined time range. This tool does <strong>not</strong>
    alone conclusively
    identify agencies and/or officers that are engaging in the
    practice of racial bias. Finally, this method does not analyze or provide
    context for the reason or cause for a traffic stop or set of
    traffic stops to be conducted by a law enforcement officer.
</p>
<p>
    This tool does not provide a customized analysis for each
    dataset and results should be considered preliminary. Further analyses
    may still be warranted to better understand the results and verify
    that the preliminary analysis has been conducted in a proper and
    legitimate manner.
</p>

<h3>How we calculated your results</h3>

<p>Traffic stop profiling analysis was performed using Python 3.9
    and statsmodels version 0.12.2</p>

<p>For analysis with an officer id, a marginal regression model was
    fit using Generalized Estimating Equations (GEE). Default
    initialization parameters were used with the exceptions of a
    logit link, binomial distribution and an exchangeable covariance
    structure with a robust variance estimator. The fitted model
    included categorical variables representing light/dark, day of
    week, year and a B-spline (degree = 6) of time in
    seconds since midnight. Officer id was specified as the group
    (cluster or "subject" variable).</p>

<p>For analysis without an officer id a binary choice logit model
    was fit. The form of the model was identical to the GEE model
    but no within-subject covariance structure was specified.</p>
