<p>
    As a summary, the Veil of Darkness approach compares the likelihood of a traffic stop occurring for a member of the target group during two time periods: the light intertwilight period and the dark intertwilight period. If target group membership is significantly more likely during the light period, when skin color may be visible, this could be evidence of racially disproportionate traffic stops.
</p>

<h3>Results Summary</h3>

<ul>
    <li>
        The relationship between membership in the target group and traffic stops during the light and dark intertwilight periods <strong>is {% if not results.significant %}<u>not</u>{% endif %} statistically significant</strong> (p={{ "%.4f" | format(results.p_value_day) }})
    </li>
    <li>
        The risk of being in the target group during the light portion of the intertwilight period is {{ "%.2f%%" | format(results.light_prob) }} and {{ "%.2f%%" | format(results.dark_prob) }} during the dark period. The relative risk ratio is {{ "%.2f" | format(results.risk_ratio_day) }} and the absolute risk difference is {{ "%.2f%%" | format(results.risk_difference_day) }}.
    </li>
</ul>

<div class="break"></div>

<h3>Interpretation</h3>

<p>
    The first part of the analysis is a statistical test on the relationship of light versus dark on the group of interest (the target group selected above), while accounting for other variables like time of day and day of the week. As an oversimplification, if the relationship is statistically significant, this means that the relationship is strong enough to merit further investigation. For a more in-depth explanation, see “More on Statistical Significance” below.
</p>

<h4>More on Statistical Significance</h4>

<p>
    Despite its widespread use, statistical significance and hypothesis testing is often misinterpreted. Here we provide more explanation of what the statistical test can tell us.<br /><br />
    A more technical definition is that a statistical test answers this question: if we assume there’s no relationship for traffic stops during light periods and dark periods among the target group, how unlikely are these results?<br /><br /> 
    The output of this statistical test is a p-value. A large p-value (greater than 0.05) means that, if we assume there was no relationship, it's likely we would see this result and a small p-value (less than 0.05) means it's unlikely we would see this result. A small p-value provides evidence for the hypothesis that racial disproportionality exists. However, a small p-value and statistically significant results are more likely with a larger sample size, which is common with traffic stop data. Thus, it is important to also review the risk ratio and risk difference for the size of the effect if results are statistically significant.<br /><br />
    While the statistical test is useful, it has several important limitations to consider:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Even though the p-value is a continuous number, it does not tell us the magnitude or direction of racial disproportionality if it exists.</li>
    <li>A large p-value, which results in a not statistically significant relationship, does not provide evidence for the absence of racial disproportionality.</li>
    <li>The statistical test does not give us a binary yes or no answer to whether there is a systemic issue with racial disproportionality in traffic stops—it can only provide evidence or fail to provide evidence for the hypothesis that racial disproportionality exists.</li>
</ul>

</ul>

<p>
    The second part of the analysis is the risk ratio, which can tell us the magnitude of disproportionality. The risk ratio is made up of two numbers: the average probability of being a member of the target group during the light period and the average probability of being a member of the target group during the dark period. The risk ratio is the ratio of these two numbers. If racial disproportionality exists, we expect the probability of being a member of the target group (assuming the target group has dark-colored skin) to be much higher during the light period (compared to the dark period) and the risk ratio much larger than 1.
</p>

<p>
    It is important to contextualize the risk ratio with both the absolute risk difference and the prior test of statistical significance. The absolute risk difference may still be small—e.g. a 2% to 1% difference is a ratio of 2, but an absolute difference of only 1%. Even if a risk ratio is large, it could be derived from a small sample size and not be statistically significant. For more on interpreting risk, see “Resources for Understanding Risk” below.

<p>The full model attempts to predict target group membership based on the following variables:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Light (1) or Dark (0) Intertwilight Period</li>
    <li>Day of Week</li>
    <li>Time of Day (B-spline with 6 degrees of freedom)</li>
    <li>Year</li>
</ul>

<div class="break"></div>

<p>If officer IDs are included in the model, a Generalized Estimating Equation (GEE) model with  a logit link, binomial distribution and an exchangeable covariance structure is used to account for within-officer correlation in traffic stops. If officer IDs are not included in the model, a logistic regression is used.</p>
