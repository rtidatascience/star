            <p>For analysis with an officer id, a marginal regression model was

                initialization parameters were used with the exceptions of a
                logit link, binomial distribution and an exchangeable covariance
                structure with a robust variance estimator. The fitted model
                included categorical variables representing light/dark, day of
                week, year and a B-spline (degree = 6) of time in
                seconds since midnight. Officer id was specified as the group
                (cluster or "subject" variable).</p>

            <p>For analysis without an officer id a binary choice logit model
                was fit. The form of the model was identical to the GEE model
                but no within-subject covariance structure was specified.</p>
